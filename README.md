 2. Handling the conversion or custom  conversion of specifiers.
 3. Using a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call write as little as possible.
 4. Handling the flag characters for non-custom conversion specifiers.
 5. Handling the  length modifiers for non-custom conversion specifiers.
 6. Handling the field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.
 7. Handling the precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.
 8. Handling the 0 flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.
 9. Handling the - flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.
